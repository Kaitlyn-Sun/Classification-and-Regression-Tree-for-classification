# Classification-and-Regression-Tree-for-classification
This project implements a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) from scratch and compares its behavior with scikit-learn’s DecisionTreeClassifier. The results demonstrate that our implementation can successfully reproduce sklearn’s predictions and class-wise performance under identical experimental settings.
